				<h3>The story so far</h3>
				<p>I began my career in 1988 as a junior programmer at Computer Business Centres (now Sanderson Proteus), on work experience from my HND IT course at Leeds Polytechnic (now Leeds Beckett University). When the placement was up I was offered a full time job as a Progress 4GL programmer. Sadly the Poly did not allow me to complete my course part time, but I have not looked back since.</p>
				<p>In the early 90's I left permanent employment and for the next 10 years I plied my trade as a Progress contractor, primarily in development and DBA roles.</p>
				<p>Around the turn of the millenium I joined forces with a friend from student days and we started Supportive, a moderately successful consultancy in Leeds offering IT solutions. Whilst at the consultancy I took on a number of roles for the first time, including Customer Support, Business Analysis and Project Management.</p>
				<p>By the mid 2000's I felt the business was not going in the direction I wanted it to, so we parted ways, and I returned to software development in permanent employment. This move paved the way for me to pick up Data Migration and advanced DBA skills.</p>
				<p>After around 4 years of this though, I got itchy feet again and plunged myself back into contracting. During this time I was able to utilise my Data Migration, Project Management and even BA skills, alongside development, my roles did not lack variety!</p>
				<p>In around 2011 an old friend asked me if I wanted to join his expanding company Intechnica and pick up a new skill - Performance Testing. I'd had a little experience of this on one of my contracts whilst I was a PM and felt it was an increasingly important function, so I jumped at the chance, learning from one of the industry's finest Ian Molyneaux. I soon found my niche in the testing field as a Technical PM, delivering managed testing services to a variety of clients. Sadly, customer requirements change and my role was made redundant as more and more clients took performance testing in-house.</p>
				<p>I started with Qualitest in April 2015. Beginning with performance and automated test projects before taking on a Test Service Manager role at EE. Most recently I have begun a strategic role with The Co-operative Group in Manchester.</p>
